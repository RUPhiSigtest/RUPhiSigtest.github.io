			<p class="info">Phi Sigma Kappa was founded on March 15th, 1873 on the campus known today as UMass. The Rutgers Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa was established in 1959 and is still in good standing with the community. We have run many fundraisers to help our national philanthropy, Special Olympics, as well as participate in many mixers, intramural events, football games, and trips to local chapters. Beyond our social and athletic passions, brothers at Phi Sigma Kappa study hard and earn high marks.</p>
